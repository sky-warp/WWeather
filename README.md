# Weather console app
This is my first time working with API, and I decided to try make some kind of weather application, which can tell current weather in your specified city. Its pretty simple - you enter the city and program'll show you the current temperature (in Celsius).

# API key
Because I dont have my own server where I can keep my own API key, and theres is no good alternative ways to safe store API-keys, I decided to keep it en environment variable, with tools provided by VisualStudio(IDK how it'll work on other IDE's). 

To get your own key, visit https://openweathermap.org/ -> create an account -> click on your account name and visit "My API keys" on the right top corner -> create a key. Then navigate to "Propierties" folder and open .json file. In filed "Your API key" insert your key, which you'd must create earlier.
